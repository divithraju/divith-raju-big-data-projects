# Big Data Project Using PySpark and Hadoop
 
This project is focused on the application of PySpark and Hadoop in a big data environment, specifically on an Ubuntu system. The goal is to demonstrate how these powerful tools can be integrated to manage and process large datasets effectively. The project covers various operations, including data handling, transformation, and storage, alongside file and directory management within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

# Tools and Technologies

# Apache Hadoop
Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers. The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a key component of this framework, providing high-throughput access to data.

# Apache Spark
Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. PySpark is the Python API for Spark, enabling easy integration of Spark's powerful capabilities within Python applications.

# Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a widely used Linux distribution known for its stability and ease of use, making it an ideal platform for setting up big data processing environments.

# Project Objectives
Data Processing
The project involves reading, transforming, and analyzing data using PySpark. The focus is on showcasing various data operations, including loading data from HDFS, performing transformations, and writing processed data back to HDFS.

# HDFS Management
The project demonstrates how to manage files and directories within HDFS, including operations like uploading and downloading files, creating and removing directories, and manipulating data stored in the distributed file system.

# System Management
In addition to data processing and HDFS management, the project also covers essential system management tasks on Ubuntu, such as monitoring system performance, managing processes, and handling file permissions.

# Conclusion
This project provides a theoretical framework for understanding the integration of PySpark and Hadoop in a big data environment. By exploring the capabilities of these tools, one can gain insights into the efficient management and processing of large datasets. The project is a valuable addition to a data engineer's portfolio, showcasing expertise in distributed computing and big data technologies.
